# 👋 Hi, I'm Johanan Abraham

I'm a Computer Science & Engineering student at The Ohio State University (Class of 2027), passionate about building meaningful software that combines AI, data, and clean design. I love working on projects that blend technical depth with real-world impact — especially anything related to cloud, machine learning, or automation.
